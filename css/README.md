The Shanti Sarvaka theme comes with shanti-main.css and shanti-search.css for those two aspects. 
A sub-theme should similarly have shanti-main-{subtheme name}.css and shanti-search-{subtheme name}.css
Use the two empty files shanti-main-sarvaka_images.css and shanti-search-sarvaka_images.css to create those
